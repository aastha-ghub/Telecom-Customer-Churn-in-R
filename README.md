# Telecom-Customer-Churn-in-R
Find out the most striking behaviour of customers through EDA and later on use some  of the predictive analytics techniques to determine the customers who are most likely to  churn.

Abstract:

Churn prediction consists of detecting which customers are likely to cancel a 
subscription to a service based on how they use the service. Individualized customer 
retention is difficult because businesses usually have a lot of customers and cannot 
afford to spend much time on one. The costs would be too high and would outweigh the 
extra revenue. However, if you could predict in advance which customers are at risk of 
leaving, you could reduce customer retention efforts by directing them solely toward 
such customers. Being able to predict churn based on customer data has proven 
extremely valuable to big telecom companies.

Dataset Information:

Customers who left within the last month – the column is called Churn Services that 
each customer has signed up for – phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online 
backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies Customer 
account information – how long they’ve been a customer, contract, payment method, 
paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges Demographic info about customers 
– gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents.[All Models.txt](https://github.com/aastha-ghub/Telecom-Customer-Churn-in-R/files/8564863/All.Models.txt)

Scope:
● Exploring insights about customer behaviour
● Data Pre-processing
● Training multiple classification algorithms to predict customer churn
● Evaluating the model with various metrics like Accuracy, AUC ROC, Precision, etc. 
and improve the score using statistical analysis over time.



Learning Outcome:

The students will get a better understanding of how the variables are linked to each 
other and build a predcitive models. They will also learn about various performance 
measures of classification models and should be able to improve these scores by taking 
the necessary step.
